                <p>
                    Though I may be doing engineering for school, I also have lots of other hobbies. I absolutely love playing and watching hockey and am a massive fan of the Edmonton Oilers. I also love cricket, football, and basketball. I love programming, especially when I'm making a game, and enjoy messing around with computer hardware as well. I also enjoy hanging out with my friends, especially out on an outdoor rink in the winter. I also enjoy doing sports statistical analyses, and am currently working on advanced analytical models for the NHL, MLB, and NBA in order to predict seasons and guage analytical values of players. I enjoy playing video games, particularly racing simulators, and also enjoy photography. I have played the guitar for over a decade now, and enjoy playing classic rock songs from The Police and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I have also started learning the piano and the drums, and hope to be as good at those as I am at the guitar. I am very big cinema fan and love analyzing movies to see why the director made the choices they did, and I also hugely enjoy listening to music. I enjoy building LEGO sets, especially the architechture sets, and I love collecting sports memorabilia like hockey cards and jerseys.
